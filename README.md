# 🏏 IPL Winner Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Every IPL season raises the same question — *which team will win this year?*  
This project uses machine learning to predict the **probability of each IPL team winning a season** based on historical team and player performance.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
To predict the IPL season winner using aggregated team-level features derived from player batting and bowling statistics.

---

## 📊 Data Used
- Batting card data (player-level)
- Bowling card data (player-level)
- Match summaries
- Points table

Data spans multiple IPL seasons.

---

## 🧠 Approach
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw data
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Aggregated player statistics to team-season level
- Built a supervised ML classification model
- Evaluated using season-wise validation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 📈 Output
The model outputs **probability scores** for each team, indicating their likelihood of winning an IPL season.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add venue-based proxy features
- Incorporate weather and pitch data using APIs
- Extend model using XGBoost or LightGBM
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit

---
## 📌 Notes
- This project was developed and executed using Google Colab.
- Due to data size constraints, datasets are not uploaded to GitHub.
- Results are probabilistic and not deterministic predictions.
